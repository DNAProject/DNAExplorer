# noUiSlider
_Current version: 4.0.0_

noUiSlider is a super tiny jQuery plugin that allows you to create range sliders.  
It fully supports touch, and it is way(!) less bloated than the jQueryUI library.

A full documentation, including examples, is available on the [noUiSlider documentation page](http://refreshless.com/nouislider/).

[CSSMinifier](http://cssminifier.com/)

**JS**  
The plugin is compressed using the Google Closure compiler, using the 'simple' optimalization option.  
[Google Closure Compiler](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home)

**Code**  
The plugin code is checked using JsLint, with the following options:
`/*jslint browser: true, devel: true, nomen: true, plusplus: true, unparam: true, sloppy: true, todo: true, white: true */`

Please note that while some errors remain, these are not issues as they are merely a difference in coding style.
